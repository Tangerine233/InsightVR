# InsightVR
 
We aim to investigate the data output generated by VR headsets in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of their functioning and data processing. We are examining real-time user interactions to inform the development of products and content for both gaming and educational purposes. Our primary focus in this study is on the structure of this data, with the aim of creating a system for accessing, storing, and analyzing this diverse dataset. This understanding will enable us to effectively bridge the divide between reality and illusion, ultimately assisting future developers. Our objective is to establish data frameworks and pipelines for the real-time observation of user data.
